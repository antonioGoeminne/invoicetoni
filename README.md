Welcome to this code! Here, I made a CRUD project of invoices 🧾 based on a frontend mentor project.

## Features

In this project, I've utilized these tools ⛏️:

- 🏎️ **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - Fast by default, with configurations optimized for performance (with the **App Directory**).
- 💅 **[CSS modules]** - CSS by itself is powerful.
- ✨ **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** and **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - For clean, consistent, and error-free code.
- 🛠️ **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - For type safety.
- 🚀 **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** - To deploy the project.
- 💯 **Perfect Lighthouse score** - Because performance matters.
- 🧪 \*\*[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - For integration tests.
- 📖 **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** - Create, test, and showcase your components.
- 🍝 **[Absolute imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases)** - No more spaghetti imports.

## How to navigate this project

You can navigate to `src/app`, where is the main page and layout and to see invoices features you can visit `src/features/invoices`

## If I had more time, I would change this

- I´d improve date and select inputs to a better experience.
- I´d add a filter and sort labels in mix with react-query.
